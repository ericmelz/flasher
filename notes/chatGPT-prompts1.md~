I am uploading a transcript of Chapter 3 of Learn Spanish.  This
transcript was created using otter.ai, which is a speech-to-text tool.
Many of the spellings rendered by the tool are not correct and need
correction.  This is particularly true for spanish.

For example:
* The spanish word "Qué" might be rendered in the transcription as "K".
* The spanish word "en" might be rendered in the transcription as "en".

Use your knowledge of spanish to generate correct pairs of (English, Spanish)
words.  In addition, render the first round of words in JSON format
resembling the example below.
